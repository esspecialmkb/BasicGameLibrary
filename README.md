# BasicGameLibrary
Building a library of commonly used methods, functions and structures that I end up trying to implement for game design. This will be a general, global library to lay the seeds for further development projects.

Current progress is being made within UI classes. Basic elements are designed, and a UI Hub is templated.

#TODO LIST
 - Finish basic UI prototype
 - Integrate previous mesh generation code
 
 - Begin multi-genre base-code development
 -> Control Scheme
 -> Menu
 -> World Persistence
 -> Animation
 
 - Begin branched-editor development
 -> This editor is planned to have the following branches
     1.) FPS
     2.) Voxel Map Builder (RPG)
     3.) Terrain editor (compatible with voxelized architecture)
     4.) Drving/Racing
